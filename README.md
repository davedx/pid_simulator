PID Simulator
===

This is a learning project to implement a PID (Proportional Integral Derivative) control system.

Because I'm feeling particularly masochistic I want to implement it in C, and for the actual control system
I want to follow JPL's safety critical software rules (found in the jpl-rules.txt file).

If I actually get something I'm satisified with I'd like to try and port it to rust too.

Let the fun begin!
